# Code Task

Task is to create a program that will parse and print quote messages from a market data feed. When invoked with an -r flag, the program should re-order the messages according to the ‘quote accept time’ at the exchange.

 The relevant parts of the market data feed are sent via UDP broadcast to ports 15515/15516. For the purposes of this exercise, a standard pcap file is supplied which you will use to parse the UDP packets. Quote packets (specified below) begin with the ASCII bytes "B6034", and contain the five current best bids and offers (or ‘asks’) on the market. Anything else should be ignored.

Your program should print the packet and quote accept times, the issue code, followed by the bids from 5th to 1st, then the asks from 1st to 5th; e.g.:

``
./parse-quote mdf-kospi200.20110216-0.pcap
``

``
    <pkt-time> <accept-time> <issue-code> <bqty5>@<bprice5> ... <bqty1>@<bprice1> <aqty1>@<aprice1> ... <aqty5>@<aprice5>
``

## Re-ordering on Accept Time
 The delay between the exchange accepting the quote and us receiving the packet fluctuates for a variety of reasons; we may even receive the packets out of order. Given an optional flag -r, your program should output the messages ordered by the quote accept time.

You should assume that the difference between the quote accept time and the pcap packet time is never more than 3 seconds.
